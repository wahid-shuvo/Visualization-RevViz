Instead of ensuring that the correct elasticsearch search was constructed, they assert that the correct query JSON is build by the elastic lib, which is knowledge CS shouldn't need to know. It should just assume that if you build a correct `Search` object, the elastic lib will get the right data from the ES API.  I don't like the old tests' implementation either (using actual requests/responses) but I think the old test cases (based on their names) are valid. For instance: - `test_sourceTakesOneInput` - `test_includePoorListingsFlagHasResults` - `test_noLimitOnASourceSpecificQuery` - `test_resultsAreSortedByScore`  All of those names sound like meaningful test cases but now they are all deleted so it is hard for us to know if we regressed on existing behaviour with these changes or even in the future.  I would suggest modifying these tests to not run `get_query()` and do the assertions on the Search object. And I would also move them to a `LookupListingsGetListingsSearchTests` class which can be a pure unittest. Then, you could keep some (not all) of the old tests, still using GAE and requests/responses but just mock out the call to `get_listings_search` or even `get_query`; if this GAE test doesn't use datastore stub, it will still be pretty fast. This approach gives you coverage to know your ES query is constructed properly but also that your API endpoint is operating as expected."

We're seeing a bunch of ""transaction too big"" errors when this code runs for listings with quite a few reviews (100ish or more). The reason is that this `lookupByReviewQuery` is happening inside of a loop over all of the reviews, meaning that we're doing potentially hundreds of synchronous queries here. Only posting this comment as an FYI - you basically never want to do synchronous RPCs inside of a loop.  Additionally, there's no reason to call delete_async() on all of the keys and then resolve the futures at the end - ndb gives us a `delete_multi` method that we can just pass a list of keys to and delete them all in a single call."

I prefer to just include it for all knockout observables so it is clear it _is_ an observable. There are a few lines above as well that could be adjusted.
