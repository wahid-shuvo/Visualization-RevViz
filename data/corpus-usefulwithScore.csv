If you're defining lists of args like you are in this handler, you can do the following: ``` REQUIRED_ARGS = [   ...   (API_KEY.ACCOUNT_SRID, API_KEY.CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER)   ... ] ```  This will require one of the two arguments",U,[0.]
56191426-2663,"	instead of setting ```current_stat``` you can enumerate ```stats``` in your loop.  EX. ``` for index, stat in enumerate(stats):   if not (stat and stat.value == 0) or index == 0:     continue      stat.value = data[index - 1] if data[index - 1] else 0   data.append([stat.datetime_stamp.strftime(formatting), stat.value]) ```",U,[0.]
55052488-2649,	It might be a bit late for this but I find ``` getGenerateReviewWidget ``` to be really confusing to read.  Could it be changed to ``` getWidgetForGenerateReviews ```?,U,[-1.]
55209092-2648,	All of these methods take a comment as the param.  Why not make a ReviewCommentActivity domain object that gets instantiated with a comment  ```python class ReviewCommentActivity(object):     def __init__(comment)     def is_valid(self)     @property     def link(self)     @property     def title(self)     def to_dict(self) ```,U,[0.]
55209278-2648,	The same could probably be done for ReviewActivity as well,U,[0.]
55210009-2648,	If you were to create the ReviewCommentActivity object you could encapsulate this logic into it. So all this would need to do is  ```python review_comment_activity = ReviewCommentActivity(activity) review_comment_activity.send() ``` Then the send method can decide whether or not to send the activity.,U,[0.]
55210166-2648,	Pylint doesn't run for this file (for long lines anyway) and it's a lot more readable if these are all on one line.,U,[-1.]

51908333-2590,	I wonder if we should put a javascript ``` try catch ``` in here.   Having the entire page fail to load because we couldn't bind our tooltips seems like a bigger problem than edge support.  We might even be able to toss the check for ``` data.is_microsoft_edge ``` if we did that. It's generally a bad smell to have browser-specific functionality.,U,[0.]
51377151-2583,"	i think ``` expired_datetime ``` is a little clearer. first time reading this i thought this was supposed to be the datetime that the account expired at, so i was confused by the +1",U,[-1.]
51142876-2569,	Do you need a binding for `form-success-icon`? Can you just add it to the `class` attr?,U,[0.]
51143002-2569,"	Minor, but I would argue `wrapper` would be a more natural naming convention than `area`.",U,[0.]
51204067-2568,"	`if 'page_title' not in context:` if you are just checking if the key exists.  I don't think anyone would set a blank `page_title`, and if they did, it was probably for a reason that's getting overwritten here.",U,[-1.]
50474793-2558,	This check should go into the `_can_send_review_share_email` as well  it doesn't really matter if we do an extra get on `ReviewGenerationConfigurationModel` when we aren't going to send the email anyway,U,[-1.]
49927773-2553,	infinite recursion!!!  should be `cls.get_by_account_group_id_async`,U,[0.]
49463253-2537,"	The whole reason jasmine uses the ``` it ``` function is so you can write English sentences like: ``` it('should start as false', ... ``` .    Kind of sad to not take advantage that feature.",U,[0.]
49465524-2537,	Why is `template_type` optional here?,U,[0.]
48563256-2511,	``` viewedComments ``` sounds to me like a function (or knockout object) that returns a set of viewed comments.  I'd recommend naming it something like ``` markCommentsAsViewed() ```.,U,[0.]
48564162-2511,	check if self.newComment() (is truthy) before sending the ajax call. dont need to send if theres no new comments anyway,U,[0.]
48567624-2511,"	I would pull these 2 tests out into a different describe block. if you are describing ""markCommentsAsViewed"", then all of your tests inside that block should call markCommentsAsViewed. If you are calling commentsToggleString, even to test that it calls markCommentsAsViewed, that test should happen inside a describe(""commentsToggleString"", function(){tests})",U,[0.]
48445700-2496,	are there things that care about ``` posts ``` being returned from this method? seems like the handler just ignores it. if this method only has to report errors then no use returning a tuple.,U,[0.]
47520060-2465,	could you change the values here from `True/False` to `'published'/'unpublised'` that was the comparison later on isn't against the string `'true'/'false'`,U,[0.]
47520617-2465,"	I'm pretty sure a request of `None` would work here, or an empty dict. I think one of the two would work.",U,[0.]
47572185-2462,"	Could probably be ``` === ```, yeah?",U,[0.]
47643593-2462,	Hmm... You're right. The server needs to receive an unpublished Flag. Would you mind fixing this function in your PR? Something like ```              else if (field.name == 'publishingStatus') {                  // convert to boolean                  if (field.value() === 'published') {                      published_flag = true;                  } else if (field.value() === 'unpublished') {                      unpublished_flag = false;                  } else {                      published_flag = null;                      unpublished_flag = null                   }              } ```,U,[0.]
47645705-2462,"	``` == ``` does type-coercion to check equality but, really, you know you want a string so why not do strict equality (``` === ```).  I don't really care, it's just Much More Betterâ„¢.",U,[-1.]
47325242-2450,	shouldn't we be setting `account.salesPerson.updated` here too? it doesn't look like it was getting set before either,U,[-1.]
47161711-2445,	any chance you'd be able to use getBySrid instead here? RepInt accounts are keyed off srid so it's a cheaper/faster/consistent lookup as opposed to getByAgid which is doing a query instead of a key.get(),U,[0.]
47258705-2445,"	This expected format comment shows a header line but your sentence above says ""without headers"".  Just to be clear, change this to: ```         expected format:         AG-1234,cust-1234         AG-5678,cust-5678"""""" ```",U,[0.]
47258985-2445,"	Why are you accepting two different key formats?  Also, I don't think you can use a `csv.DictReader` without headers. How would this `.get('key')` know which column in the file has that key? This code looks like it is expecting CSV headers.",U,[-1.]
47259233-2445,	What does `updateUnique` do?  Why not just: ``` account.customer_id = customer_id account.put() ``` ?,U,[-1.]
47259452-2445,"	This line is very awkward. We are building a customer ID and storing it in a `customer_id` variable but that function takes in an arg also called `customer_id`. Why is the original value of the variable not good enough? I thought customer IDs were just strings anyway, what could this `buildCustomerId` function possibly be doing?",U,[-1.]
47292312-2445,	Why did you change this from using updateUnique? I know @jwebb-va asked why we were using it but there is a reason to do so... it handles the updating of the unique entity for you and also ensures that it's in the correct format (pid/id). So you can replace about 15-20 lines here with the one call to updateUnique instead.,U,[-1.]
47158578-2444,	I'd say `generate_content` is a bit too ambiguous here. Even within the context of this module it's not clear what this actually does or returns. Even something like `generate_review_share_content` would be much clearer imo.,U,[-1.]
47158625-2444,	Why not just `{}`?,U,[0.]
47358780-2441,"	Minor, but is it necessary to wrap all these methods around `function () {...}` if you aren't passing any ""custom"" args? Can't you just `click: $root.showTrendOrWordCloudAdvice`?",U,[0.]
